This project involved creating a simple text-based RPG game, allowing players to select a character and engage in combat with an enemy. The goal was to demonstrate core programming concepts like object-oriented design and control flow. The project excelled in implementing an object-oriented structure, making it easy to extend and add new character classes with unique behaviors. Code efficiency and security could be enhanced by using smart pointers to manage memory and implementing better input validation to prevent errors and exploits. Designing a flexible character system was challenging but was managed through the use of polymorphism and virtual functions, which allowed each character class to have its own behavior. The project reinforced object-oriented programming, class inheritance, and game loop implementationâ€”skills that are broadly applicable in software development. The program was made maintainable and adaptable by using clear, concise methods, following single responsibility principles, adding comments, and maintaining consistent naming conventions.
